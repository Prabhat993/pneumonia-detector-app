# AI Pneumonia Detector 🫁✨

This is a full-stack web application that uses a Deep Learning model (a Convolutional Neural Network) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

The user can upload an X-ray, and the app will provide a real-time prediction: **"Normal 😊"** or **"Pneumonia Detected 😷"**.

## 🌐 Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern full-stack architecture:

* **🧠 Backend (The "Brain"):**
    * **Python:** The core programming language.
    * **Flask:** A lightweight web server to create and serve the prediction API.
    * **TensorFlow & Keras:** Used to build, train, and run the CNN deep learning model.

* **⚛️ Frontend (The "Face"):**
    * **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building the dynamic user interface.
    * **Axios:** Used to make API requests from the React app to the Flask backend.
    * **CSS-in-JS:** All styling is handled directly within the React components for a modern, colorful UI.
